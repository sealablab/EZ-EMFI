Description:

## Summary
Architecture analysis of mono-repo refactor planning document (commit b0cb32bb).

## Documents Added
- ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md (7,600 words) - Cross-repo analysis
- FORGE_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md (6,800 words) - Forge architecture patterns
- docs/MONO_REPO_ITERATION_PROMPT.md (662 lines) - Iterative design guide
- START_HERE.md - Branch overview and next steps

## Key Findings
- Planning doc underestimates complexity 3-4x (8-12h → 32-46h)
- 7 critical architectural gaps identified
- Recommends iterative spike branch approach (13-18h with validation)

## Next Steps
1. Review analysis on dev laptop
2. Create spike branches to validate 4 critical decisions
3. Iterate until architecture validated
4. Execute migration with confidence

See START_HERE.md for detailed instructions.
